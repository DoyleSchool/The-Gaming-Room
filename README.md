// Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  // The client, The Gaming Room, is a gaming company which requested aide in the expansion of a game from an android only compatability to a 
     web based application with cross-platform capabilities. With the main expansion focused on various device and OS support, integrating other
     capabilities such multi-player and unique naming parameters.
// What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  // Documentation of of business reaquirements, revisions and suggestions along with technilogical requirements offered a robust and compprehensive
     software design document for the client. Though best practices and methods such as iteration singleton verifications were used, especially 
     regarding OOP practices, The documentation will aide in business decisions and future developments. 
// What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  // The document creation and contributions allowed for a mapping and record of the program to be used in the development itself. It helped layout
     the programs needs, requirements, scalability, memory management and security. With a side by side analysis of the capabilitied and drawbacks of various
     OS, it allowed for a unique development of a game which met the clients needs.
// If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  // I would exppand on the inline comments to better describe the intent and functionality of sections to help aide and be combined weith the software design
     document to provide better understanding of the program and aide in future developments.
// How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  // Breakikng down the needs of the client/customer allows for a detailed list on requirements/ non-negotiables and develop a work breakdown structure 
     for timing and execution.
// How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  // Firstly, identifiying the requirements of the games functionality and compatability. Next, was the process of defining and adressing both
     the platform tradeoffs of cross platform functionality and any design constraints for the application.
